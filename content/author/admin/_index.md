I'm a PhD Student in Computational Linguistics at the University of Washington and a member of the <a href="https://wiki.ling.washington.edu/bin/view.cgi">Computational Linguistics</a> and <a href="http://www.depts.washington.edu/phonlab/">Phonetics lab groups</a>.  My advisor is <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/levow/">Gina Levow.</a>  My research includes using language models to examine statistical anomalies in speech and modeling human transcription errors to learn more about human perception and improve the transcription process.  I've recently worked with Amazon's Alexa Machine Learning team to apply deep learning methods to speech recognition. Thanks for stopping by!
