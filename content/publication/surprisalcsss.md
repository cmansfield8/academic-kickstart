abstract = "In this study, we examine factors that lead to the misperception of speech in conversational speech transcription, an area which has had little previous research.  We investigate the role of surprisal, a measure of expectedness and language processing effort, on perceptions.  A dataset of word errors was generated using two sets of transcriptions that have undergone two iterations, where the second transcription was hand-corrected to reduce the error rate.  Errors fell into three basic categories: insertions, deletions, and substitutions.  The dataset includes surprisal measures and syntactic information about word errors and their respective baselines.  Surprisal was calculated using a trigram model and LSTM neural network.  Using linear effects models, we find that the category of error and syntactic class have a complex relationship to surprisal.  A qualitative analysis shows that transcribers in the first iteration generate errors which lead to a more formal grammatical structure.  Future work will consider expectedness of lexical and acoustic information and its relationship to misperceptions."
